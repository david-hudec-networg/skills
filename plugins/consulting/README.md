Business analysis and process modeling with [UBML](https://github.com/TALXIS/ubml),
TALXIS's open YAML-based business-modeling language. Four skills forming one
evidence-first pipeline: a discovery source is registered and mined into insights,
every insight is walked with a stakeholder until they confirm or reject it, the
confirmed ones are promoted into the operational model, and nothing commits
without validation.

The chain the plugin exists to protect is **source, then insight, then model**.
Any field in the resulting model walks back to the sentence someone said, and to
the moment a human agreed it should be modelled that way.

| Skill | Use when… |
|---|---|
| `extract-insights` | a transcript, interview or document arrives and the workspace should learn from it |
| `validate-insights` | extracted claims and the elements they propose need signing off, one bundle at a time |
| `promote-to-model` | the joins no single insight could decide - merges, ordering, entry and exit points |
| `validate-model` | schema and cross-reference checking a workspace; gating every commit on zero errors |

Each skill steers the agent to the [`ubml` CLI](https://github.com/TALXIS/ubml)
for the *how*. `sources` and `insights` are 1.4 document types, so pin the major
version: `npx ubml@1.4 <command>`.

Worth pinning rather than trusting whatever is installed. In 1.3, `validate` on
a directory ran only the id cross-reference pass: it accepted illegal enum
values, invented properties and missing required fields without a word, so a
clean bill of health meant only that the YAML parsed.

## Two rules that span the pipeline

**Extraction and review are two branches.** The extraction lands on one, the
walk branches off it, and `git diff extraction..walk` is then exactly what the
review changed. Put them on one branch and whoever reads it afterwards cannot
tell the forty-five claims somebody wrote from the nine the reviewer corrected,
which is the only part they are being asked to check.

**The conversation is in the reviewer's language; the workspace is in English.**
A reviewer reading a second language, following a meeting they did not attend
and judging an extraction at the same time is carrying three things at once, and
the one that is easiest to put down is the language. Talk in theirs. Claims,
notes, quotes, source entries and commit messages stay English, because the
workspace outlives the session and the next reader is not guaranteed to share
the room's language.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add TALXIS/skills
/plugin install consulting@talxis
```

## Try it

Point the agent at a directory of discovery material and say "model this business
in UBML". `extract-insights` registers the source and mines it; the pipeline takes
it from there through review, promotion and validation.
