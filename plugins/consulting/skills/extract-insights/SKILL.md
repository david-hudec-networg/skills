name: extract-insights
description: Registers a discovery source in a UBML business-modeling workspace and mines it for insights - pains, opportunities, process facts, decisions, risks, constraints - each traceable to the source it came from and each marked unreviewed until a human confirms it. First step of the extract-insights → validate-insights → promote-to-model → validate-model pipeline. Use when a transcript, interview, document or meeting recording arrives and the workspace should learn from it.

# Extract insights

**Contract:** one source in, claims out. Register the source, walk it once, turn
every distinct claim into an insight citing it. Nothing is interpreted before it
is registered, nothing is claimed without a source, everything lands `proposed`.
Model files stay untouched.

## Ask the CLI first

```
npx ubml@1.4 init <name>    # scaffold a workspace, never write one by hand
ubml show                   # what the workspace already holds
ubml schema sources         # the document shapes
ubml schema insights
ubml add sources            # scaffold a document that does not exist yet
ubml nextid SR              # allocate every id
```

Never write a UBML file from memory of the schema. If the validator rejects an
edit, the edit is wrong. `add` scaffolds a new document; extending one is a
manual edit.

## Sequence

1. **Frame the workspace.** One workspace document per directory; if two exist,
   ask which is canonical. Name files for the document type, never the subject:
   `insights.ubml.yaml`, not `billing.insights.ubml.yaml`. Elements already
   carry a name and description, so a subject prefix only guarantees a second
   place to look.

2. **Register the source before reading it for meaning.** `SR#####` with name,
   type, date, participants and a `file` pointer to where the artefact lives.
   The workspace records the source, it does not store it. Snapshot anything
   mutable, or the evidence changes under the model.

3. **Walk it once, end to end.** One insight per distinct claim: the claim in
   the speaker's vocabulary, a `kind`, `status: proposed`, the `SR#####`,
   honest `confidence`, `attribution` and `date`, and verbatim source text in
   `context`.

   - `decision` records that a choice was taken; `constraint` records a limit
     the model must respect. Something agreed whose operative content is a
     boundary is a constraint, and how it was reached goes in `notes`.
   - Quote warts included. Widen a quote that does not parse alone rather than
     tidying it; mark a join across non-adjacent passages.

4. **Link, don't merge.** A second source repeating a claim becomes a second
   insight `related` to the first - silent de-duplication destroys the
   corroboration. Contradictions are related and both stay `proposed`. A later
   source settling an earlier question uses `supersedes`, which takes exactly
   one id; chain them rather than pointing the newest at everything.

5. **A derived source is not a second witness.** Ask where the second source got
   the claim before treating agreement as convergence. A proposal written from a
   client's outline repeats one testimony. Record the restatement, mark it
   derivative in `notes`, and do **not** raise the original's `confidence`:
   otherwise four documents in one paper trail turn a single unverified
   statement into the best-evidenced fact in the workspace.

6. **Close the loop.** Every claim ends up an insight or an explicit "ignored,
   not actionable" note. Say which and how many. Judge that against the source,
   never against a model - capture who is involved, what they do, in what order,
   what they need, and above all why anyone decided any of it.

7. **Re-sweep when the target changes.** Extraction is shaped by what you have
   somewhere to put: a workspace holding only insights leaves structural claims
   behind, because "an order line carries a quantity" reads as mechanics and has
   no file to belong to. When the workspace gains document types, go back over
   the sources already walked - not to re-validate, but for what the earlier pass
   had no reason to see. The tell is a field appearing in a design argument that
   no insight states.

8. **Hand off.** `validate-insights` confirms, `promote-to-model` models,
   nothing commits without `validate-model`.

## Invariants

- Sources before insights, validated insights before model elements.
- Every insight cites a resolvable, pre-registered `SR#####`.
- Everything lands `proposed`. `confidence` is yours, `status` is the
  reviewer's; direct observation high, hearsay low, unattributed flagged.
- A claim that sounds like a model statement still lands as an insight.
- A risk raised and not taken up is still an insight - worth most precisely
  when nobody acted on it.
- Structural statements count. "An order line carries a quantity" reads as
  mechanics and gets dropped, then a design argument runs without it.
- Model the business twin only. Delivery-side content - the consultancy's own
  sprints, contracts, pricing, staffing - stays out.
- Transcripts substitute unfamiliar names for familiar ones. Check proper nouns
  against another source and record the substitution on the source entry.
- Exports are lossy: never commit them, never round-trip edits through them.
